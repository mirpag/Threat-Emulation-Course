# The Cycle of Threat Intelligence

There are typically five processes in a method or cycle of threat intelligence.&#x20;

1. Goals&#x20;
2. Collection
3. Processing (analysis)&#x20;
4. Dissemination&#x20;
5. Feedback

There needs to be some type of objective or _**goal**_ to achieve with threat intelligence. What is it? What questions do you have about the threat and threat actors? That may be driven by the types of services ab organization offers. Any organization involved in any type of work with the Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Justice (DoJ), or any type of defense or federal criminal justice organizations, then nation state threat actors would be a type of threat group to know their TTPs.

Once the organization's goals are known and there are questions that need to be answered, the next step is to find sources to **collect** information to help respond to organizational questions and their goals. Data collection can come from a variety of sources.  Twitter is a very powerful threat intelligence platform. By following the right people, organizations can have a heads up on lots of things going on before it ever gets into the media. There are threat intelligence platforms like MISP and AlienVault that provide information useful for intelligence analysts to keep up with and manage the behavior of threat actors. Some information sources to inform threat intelligence analysts are commercial and require payment or the analyst to be a member of the organization to receive threat reports.&#x20;

So where do you get your information from? Where do you collect it from? It's going to be based on the industry that you're in. There are some threat intelligence feeds that are only available to people in specific industries. They receive intelligence based on threats specific to their industry.&#x20;

Next is to **process** that information, which also includes analysis as well. Analysts are going to take that raw data and put it into a format, and extract relevant information. If the analyst is able to obtain the source code for tools, they can determine the behaviors of the tools and the potentially the goal of the threat actor.&#x20;

Processing should help with plucking out information to help you answer the organizational questions - the goals, the objectives, etc. It also includes analysis. Analysts are interpreting the information that they're extracting. Analysts have to take raw data and analyzing it to determine if it is good data and if it will help answer the question(s) for the organization.&#x20;

Next the analysts **disseminates** their analysis.They're going to make it available to their customer or even make it available to the public. Dissementation can occur via the public internet or well-known sites or to customers via secure channels, via in-person meetings, or via phone calls. Some  organizations have weekly briefings with all of their their customers to help them understand new intell about threats.
*NOTE: if your SOC or MSSP have these types of meetings, inquire how they are monitoring **your** organization and if they have seen the activity targeting their **your** organization*.&#x20;

Finally, there's **Feedback**. Once the analyst has a  finished report and disseminates it, those who consume the information will let them know if the information was relevant, if it was usable, or if it was not actionable. Threat intelligence reports may, though not always explain how to use the information.&#x20;
