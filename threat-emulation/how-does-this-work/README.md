# How Does This Work?

### Threat Intelligence!

Threat Intelligence really drives the threat emulation program. Threat Intelligence essentially helps to understand and identify those adversaries and understand their motivations and behaviors because it's specific. Threat intell can uncover the industry an adversary is targeting. Some may be targeting education, legal, and/or industrial control, while others have no interest in those. Threat intelligence is also actionable, which means it provides information that allows taking action to detect and mitigate the threats.  

*NOTE: Even if athreat actor doesn't target your industry, it is still good to read threat intell reports any chance you get.* However, focus on what is most applicable to your organization or the organizations monitored by a SOC or MSSP.

An MSSP and SOC, should subscribe to or have a robust threat intelligence program or subscribe to threat intell feeds relevant to the organizations that are monitored. 

*NOTE: Be aware, that you may have to read through many threat intell reports. One task you can do to help mitigate or minimize the amount of work for one or two people is to split up the the task.  If you have a threat actor targeting six different industries, and you have three SOC analysts, have each analyst focused on two industries. Then, you can get together and discuss the findings and decide how to go about creating an emulation plan, and ensuring the data sources needed to detect their behaviors are in place.*&#x20;

The key word with threat intelligence there is that it's actionable. A threat intelligence report is there for people who need to know what the threat actor is up to, what the motivations are, what are their TTPs, and if it applies to the organization. As you read a threat intell report, consider the steps required to mitigate the threats, let senior leadership know to get buy-in for purchases that can help detect or mitigate the threats, and what your current security program can detect.  Then, perform a threat eumulation exercise.

Threat intelligence also helps support threat hunting. The more threat hunters know about the various adversaries targeting the industry, then the behaviors, the TTPs, help to really inform and drive their hunting capabilities, direction, scope, and focus.&#x20;
