# How Does This Work?

### Threat Intelligence!

Threat Intelligence is the habit. It really drives your threat emulation program. Threat Intelligence essentially helps you to understand and identify those adversaries and understand their motivations and behaviors. Because it's specific, they are specific to the industry and organization that you're in. There are some which do not care about the healthcare industry. They're focused on the energy sector or the legal sector. Some may be targeting education, legal, industrial control, while others have no interest in those. So threat intelligence is actionable. Which means when you read about a threat actor, it's okay to look to see what their capabilities are. You want to see what is actually applicable to your organization.

Now, if you work in MSSP, and you're a SOC shop, then you may have need to need a very robust threat intelligence program based on the industry's systems that you're monitoring. You all may have to read about a lot of different threat actors. One thing you can do to help mitigate or minimize the amount of work for one or two people is to split up the the of the task. So if you have a threat actor targeting six different industries, and you have three SOC analysts, have each analyst focused on two industries. Then, you can get together and discuss the information you find so that you can then make use of that.&#x20;

The key word with threat intelligence there is is actionable. A threat intelligence report is there for people who need to know what the threat actor is up to, what the motivations are, and if it applies to the organization. What behaviors are you looking for? What actionable steps can I take to monitor and hunt - if needed - for the adversary?&#x20;

Threat intelligence also helps support threat hunting. The more you know about the various adversaries targeting the industry, then the behaviors, the TTPs, help to really inform and drive your hunting capabilities, direction, scope, and focus. We're going to talk about some aspects here, for threat intelligence.&#x20;
