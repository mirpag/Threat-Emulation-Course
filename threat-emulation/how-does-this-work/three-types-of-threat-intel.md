# Three Types of Threat Intel

There are typically three types of threat intelligence.

1. Strategic&#x20;
2. Operational
3. Tactical

In some other places, you may see "technical" rather than "tactical"!
{% endhint %}

_**Strategic threat intelligence**_ is for executives, really. That's where they are working with the threat analyst, and trying to understand what risks are being posed.&#x20;

If the organization decides to do XYZ within the next few years, or if they want to offer XYZ product or service, what risk does that pose? Well, who are the threat actors that may want to take advantage of any risk and vulnerabilities that are exposed? Are there known threat actors that will immediately make this a very difficult and painful process for them to move forward?&#x20;

Threat intelligence collection has to be exhaustive and extensive, for executives to be able to make those decisions. And that's where knowing the organizaton's  goals is really important. What are the questions the executives are asking? That will help guide the collection capabilities or the collection activities.&#x20;

**Operational threat intelligence.** Once the threat actors have been identified it needs to be determined what are their capabilities? What is their intent? How prolific are they? What are their funding sources? That's critical. If a threat actor is state funded or nation state funded by the government or the military, their resources are practically unlimited. It can make the actionable steps much more important and detrimental to have strong security controls in place or decide whether or not they choose to have that risk present in their organization. Are you going to offer the service, but outsource it to another organization? That doesn't mean it absolves the organization of their responsibility for protecting the data or keeping a service secured. It simply means they're letting the organization know that there are threat actors that could target them. These are their capabilities, and here's their intent. Here's the likelihood that they may actually take advantage or try to take advantage of that. You're not telling the organization not to do XYZ, you're providing them information so they can make an informed decisions.&#x20;

**Tactical threat intelligence** is sometimes called technical threat intelligence as well. This lets the SOC analysts, the security professionals and threat hunters know what needs to be done to monitor, detect, and protect the organization.&#x20;

Threat actor behaviors and TTPs are used interchangeably, just so it becomes clear that TTPs really are based on behaviors.

Threat intell really drives the emulation. It helps understand the behaviors and how to emulate the behavior and learn to detect it within an organization.&#x20;
