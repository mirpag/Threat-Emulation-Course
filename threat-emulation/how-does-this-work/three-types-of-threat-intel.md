# Three Types of Threat Intel

There are typically three types of threat intelligence.

1. Strategic&#x20;
2. Operational
3. Tactical

In some other places, you may see "technical" rather than "tactical"!
{% endhint %}

_**Strategic threat intelligence**_ is for executives, really. That's where they are working with you as the threat analyst, and trying to understand what risks are being posed.&#x20;

If the organization decides to do XYZ within the next few years, or if they didn't want to offer XYZ product or service, what risk does that pose? Well, who are the threat actors that may want to take advantage of any risk and vulnerabilities that are exposed? Are there known threat actors that will immediately make this a very difficult and painful process for them to move forward?&#x20;

Your threat intelligence collection has to be pretty exhaustive and extensive, for executives to be able to make those decisions. And that's where knowing those goals is really important. What are the questions the executives are asking? That will help guide your collection capabilities or your collection activities.&#x20;

_**Operational threat intelligence.**_ Once you've identified the threat actors and threat groups, what are the capabilities? What are they? What is their intent to do? Will they target the organizations that you're creating this report for? How prolific are they? What are their funding sources? That's critical. If a threat actor is state funded or nation state funded by the government or the military, their resources are practically unlimited. It can make the actionable steps much more important than detrimental to have strong security controls in place or decide whether or not you choose to have that risk present your organization. Are you going to have the service, but outsource it to another organization? That doesn't mean that absolves you of your responsibility for protecting that data or keeping a service secure. It simply means you're letting the organization know that there are threat actors. These are their capabilities, and here's their intent. Here's the likelihood that they may actually take advantage or try to take advantage of that. You're not telling the organization not to do XYZ, you're providing them information. With that they have to make that informed decision on how they're going to manage and handle the risk of those threat actors.&#x20;

_**Tactical threat intelligence**_ is sometimes called technical threat intelligence as well. This lets you - all the SOC analysts, the security professionals, assistant administrators - if they get involved in this, it's letting you know what you need to do to protect the organization. From the behaviors and the techniques, tactics, and procedures of that of the organization.&#x20;

I'm going to state behaviors and TTPs fairly redundantly, just so it becomes clear that TTPs really are based on behaviors. You're learning those behaviors so that you know what to monitor and what to look for. And also, what controls you need to put in place to mitigate - though those threats - especially the initial access. How would they actually get into the organization to perform their behaviors? If you can put strong controls in place to prevent the initial access, then you're doing your job extremely well, and making it even more painful because disrupt that behavior.&#x20;

As I mentioned before, threat intel really drives for emulation. That drives the threat hunters as well. It helps them understand the behaviors and what to look for and how to look for the threat actors that may already exist within the organization.&#x20;
