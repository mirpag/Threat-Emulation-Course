# What is it?

Now, to start off, _what is threat emulation_? Threat emulation, to put it simply, is the process of simulating a threat the organization is likely to encounter to conduct an in-depth cybersecurity analysis.&#x20;

Threat emulation will help you understand and be able to determine if your monitoring capabilities are able to pick up threat actor behaviors.

You are going to eventually find this as part of your threat emulation and threat intelligence program.&#x20;

This is not a workshop that you attend and then go off on your own to test in your own environment. Now, this is a program -a process- that I hope that you will learn to integrate into your organization.
