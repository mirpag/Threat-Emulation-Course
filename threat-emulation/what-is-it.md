# What is it?

Now, to start off, _what is threat emulation_? Threat emulation, to put it simply, is the process of simulating a threat the organization is likely to encounter to conduct an in-depth cybersecurity analysis.&#x20;

Threat emulation will help you understand and be able to determine if your monitoring capabilities are able to pick up threat actor behaviors.

You are likley to find threat emulation an ideal investment in your organization's overall security program.  Also, it is good for continuous learning and professional development with emulating behiavors of threat actors.&#x20;

This is not a course to only read through. You want to engage by working through the threat emulation exercise at the end of the course.  Threat emulation could become a **process** that I hope you will learn to integrate into your organization.
