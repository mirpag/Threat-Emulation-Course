# Testing Custom Legal Warning Banner

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/kxCBuXF5-Bc" %}

We are going to create an operation based on our current Change Logon Legal Warning to make sure this works as expected.&#x20;

1. To start this, make sure you are logged out of your Windows machine. Sign out if needed.&#x20;
2. In your Caldera window, click on "Operations".
3. Click "Start New Operation". Name the Operation name "Test Logon Banner". Change the Adversary to "PYSA Sample Emulation".
4. Click on "Advanced", then click on the option to "Auto close operation". Don't worry about any other settings.&#x20;
5. Click "Start", and let this run.&#x20;
6. Once this has completed, move over to your Windows machine to check to see if it worked. You should get a screen saying that "Your data has been encrypted".&#x20;
7. Move back to your "Quick Connect" window, and run the command we wrote before in the Powershell ISE application.&#x20;
