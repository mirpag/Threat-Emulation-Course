# Welcome!

## Welcome aboard!

Thank you for participating in this workshop. I also want to thank your supervisor who understands and sees the value that this workshop is going to bring to you.

The purpose of this workshop is to lay the groundwork for what you're going to be doing, to explain what threat emulation is, and some threat emulation principles. It will all culminate in a workshop where you're going to do hands-on work. You will perform a threat emulation exercise, using an open source tool, called Dyre Mitre that you can use for your own purposes.
