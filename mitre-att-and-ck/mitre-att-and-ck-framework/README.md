# Mitre Att\&ck Framework

We're going to look at the Mitre Att\&ck framework. The Mitre Att\&ck framework is really, almost a standard these days for describing and tracking the  behavior of adversaries based on their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP). Those are, as we saw with Bianco's Pyramid of Pain, at the top level that makes it very difficult for the adversary to hide their tracks. The tools might change, the hashes may change, the IP addresses and domains may change, but the behaviors don't change much.&#x20;

Why wasn't that discussed in the last section? If the adversaries attacks are working, if they're able to get into systems and achieve their goals, they're going to keep at it. They may change the different types of tools as they become more well known. The behavior is important in threat intelligence for attributing the attack to a known or new threat group so understanding the behavior, the TTPs they use, are really important.&#x20;

Let's jump right into the Mitre Att\&ck framework. Here is the Mitre Att\&ck matrix.&#x20;

the Att&ck framework can be very intimidating. though this section is to help understand the framework and break through the intimidation factor.
