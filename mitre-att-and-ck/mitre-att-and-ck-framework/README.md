# Mitre Att\&ck Framework

We're going to look at the Mitre Att\&ck framework. The Mitre Att\&ck framework is really, almost a standard these days. By all means, I'm not gonna say it is the standard, but it helps to track and map out the behavior of adversaries based on their tactics, techniques, and procedures. Those are, as we saw with Bianco's Pyramid of Pain is a top level that makes it very difficult for the adversary to hide their tracks. The tools might change, the hashes may change, the IP addresses and domains may change, but the behaviors don't change much.&#x20;

Now, why is that I didn't talk about that during the last section? If the adversaries attacks are working, if they're able to get into systems and achieve their goals, they're going to keep at it. They may change the different types of tools as they become more well known. Or, a threat group may use ransomware, for example. They may use a specific type of ransomware. But, they change the behavior of it, and it still performs very similar actions. The behavior is important in threat intelligence for understanding the adversary who is behind the attack. So the TTPs are really important.&#x20;

Let's jump right into the Mitre Att\&ck framework. Here is the Mitre Att\&ck matrix.&#x20;

I can admit, when I first saw this a few years ago, I was intimidated by it as I had no idea how to interpret this thing. We're going to look at this and break through the intimidation factors and overwhelming factors that may arise. To demonstrate this, you can go to the tech website, which always has the latest version and information on it. You can also use this completely offline, especially if you're in an environment where you need to be offline. I downloaded the Att\&ck website, which you can also do via GitHub.&#x20;

I'm going to use the offline version, just to show you how this all works. You can see this is the custom interface, the official website can be found at attack.mitre.org. This is where you'll find the framework if you don't want to save it offline.&#x20;
