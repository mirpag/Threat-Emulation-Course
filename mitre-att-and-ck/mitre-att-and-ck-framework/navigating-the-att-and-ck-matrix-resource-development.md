# Navigating the Att\&ck Matrix - Resource Development

So let's hop back over to the Att\&ck framework. We have resource development. Whether you have methods that they use in order to start to plan their attack, the adversary is trying to establish resources they can use to support operations. They take the reconnaissance information, analyze it, and then start to developing methods in which they can use to carry out their attack. As you can see, during the reconnaissance phase they can find compromised accounts, for example. Or what they found made them able to determine access to email accounts. Maybe there was a password file out on the public web server. Or they're able to compromise the infrastructure using other information that was found. Let's say they have a DNS server that was vulnerable  or a cloud based server that was vulnerable.

&#x20;Botnet, what does this mean? "Adversaries may compromise numerous third-party systems to form a botnet that can be used during targeting". You have to get a lot of systems if you really want to be a really effective botnet. Then they can be used to cause a distributed denial of service. All those bots connect to a remote system at one time, sending a little bit of data. If you have hundreds of 1000s of those doing that at one time, then you can really put a put pressure on the network resources on the system.
