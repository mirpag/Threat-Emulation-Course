# Navigating the Att\&ck Matrix - Resource Development

When the threat actor has enough information, the move to Resource Development is where they are developing methods to carry out their attack. During the reconnaissance phase they may have found compromised accounts, for example, or what they found made them able to determine access to email accounts. Maybe there was a password file out on the public web server or they're able to compromise the infrastructure using other information that was found.

&#x20;Botnet, what does this mean? "Adversaries may compromise numerous third-party systems to form a botnet that can be used during targeting". A threat actor has to compromise a lot of systems for an  effective botnet to carry out their goal. All those bots connect to a remote system at one time, sending a little bit of data. If you have hundreds of thousands of those doing that at one time, then you can really put pressure on the network resources on the system.
