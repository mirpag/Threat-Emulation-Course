# Navigating the Att\&ck Matrix - Discovery

Then we have discovery. As part of the process for enumerating the organization, discovery means that in order to start to figure out what other systems you have in organization, the users, devices, etc. that can have many purposes. One it could be to maintain or try to maintain persistence on other systems, find other systems that they can compromise to escalate privileges, or find out where your sensors are and evade those. To gain credential access, they can find another system that they can compromise and potentially get admin access to. Then, they can dump credentials.&#x20;

Every process in one of these tactics here, you know, it depends on the attack group. Not all are going to perform the same actions. So that discovery may have different purposes. And again, here are the techniques that they use for discovery.&#x20;
