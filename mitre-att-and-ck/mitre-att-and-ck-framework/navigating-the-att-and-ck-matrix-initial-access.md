# Navigating the Att\&ck Matrix - Initial Access

So for the most part, these two \[Reconnaissance and Resource Development], were added on later in the process of developing the Mitre Att\&ck framework. It is updated on a pretty routine basis. These help provide information on how adversaries start to carry out their operation.&#x20;

But what they want to get to is this initial access. This is number one, this is how they get into the system. This is really important. So this initial access, this is a start of their campaign. This is where they're trying to get into your network. They do that via techniques such as drive-by compromise and phishing.

Let's look at phishing because people are very familiar with phishing. With phishing, you have these techniques. If you open this up, it gives you a definition of what phishing is just like before. But I want you to notice over here, the act of ADDIE for this technique. Here are the sub techniques. If we click on one of these, one type of fishing is spearfishing attachment. And again, it has its own ID dot 001 sub-technique of phishing. The tactic is initial access. This is the goal tactic.&#x20;

Now platforms these are the known platforms in which spear phishing works. Now the reason why I have Linux Windows and Mac OS is because those are the most common ones on the internet. Yes, there are other operating systems out there and BSTs etc. But they're targeting these particularly because they have more information about these. Okay, so what this means here is that spearfishing attachments, excuse me, spear phishing attachments. Sub technique applies to Linux, Windows and Mac OS as to get more information about other operating systems and they're updated here. Okay. Once again, this is invaluable for our sock analyst data sources, because this is telling you how you can detect spear phishing attacks or attempts. So if you have access to application logs, application log content, network traffic, that's how you can monitor for spearfishing. And then this, Quebec ID. If we open this under tab, you'll see that it's the common attack pattern enumeration a classification, meaning this is a well known attack. And this is a generic definition of what spearfishing is. So you can click on this to get more information. Right. And as we scroll down, you start to see procedure examples. Now what does this mean? procedure examples. What we're looking at are groups in a G right there, that means groups. This is a group that is known to use spearfishing this group. The this group admin at 338, has sent emails with malicious word Microsoft Office documents attached. So they're telling you about this group here. If I click on this group ID, I get more information about that known threat group. So this is again, one of the benefits of the attack framework is that maps out the techniques, the TTPs, techniques, tactics and procedures for known, well known threat groups is a definition form. And these are all the techniques that are used by this particular threat actor. So you can see they do a lot of different things on the system. And this is a type of software they use this s, this is a software. And just like with our tactics and techniques, each group has an ID. And then, you know, attribution for who provided the information about the threat group and other metadata you see here. Same thing with software, but click on this s here. Then his bubble wrap. You can see right, here's a backdoor. It has its own ID. Here's the associated software right here. And then type is Boulware platform, it impacts his windows. So once again, good information. So now you know that you can look at Ubinas platforms for the software bubble wrap. Alright, now, here's some of the techniques that are used for bubble wrap, as you see right here. And you can see groups that use the software.
