# Navigating the Att\&ck Matrix - Lateral Movement

Lateral movement is when they move to other systems in organization. That's what makes incident response and cleanup very difficult. Because you need to understand the behavior of the adversaries and what their tools are first, and then start to use tools and other resources to determine on which systems they reside on.&#x20;

As I mentioned before, if you have 100 systems, the attackers will probably compromise about 10 of those just to maintain access they want. It's not likely that they are going to compromise all 100 systems. But once it's been compromised, it's going to be highly inactive. That's the the main thing sleeping is waiting for, to perform some action. This lateral movement is when mass compromises are, or do become a nightmare in the organization. These are the techniques that are used to achieve this goal of lateral movement.&#x20;
