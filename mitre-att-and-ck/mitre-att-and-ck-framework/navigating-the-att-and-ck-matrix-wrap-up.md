# Navigating the Att\&ck Matrix - Wrap-up

That covers the tactics that are used, and the goals of the operations. Once again, threat actors may not use the same tactics all the time, it depends on what their goal is. What is their mission? What are they trying to get? They may stop after they execute a command that searches a system for information. They zip it up, they exfiltrate it, and they're out of there. Now, the malicious code may stay behind, or it may be set to automatically delete after reboot. But they may not have a command and control, they may not try to move to other systems. The system they wanted, they were able to get it during their initial access.

So the goal of these are the techniques to accomplish each one of these the techniques and sub techniques.&#x20;

The procedures with P come from the procedures. These are what they actually perform, to carry out the attack. So that's we get TTP from - tactics, techniques and procedures. That's the Mitre Att\&ck framework. The way to look at this is to actually look at reports and start looking at these various techniques, tactics, and the procedures associated with each one of them.&#x20;

So this Att\&ck Matrix is at attack.mitre.org. But I was showing you how you can use this completely offline for your own internal purposes, especially if the tech website is unavailable. You still have access to all this rich information.&#x20;

In the next section, we're going to use the Att\&ck navigator in order to start learning how to create heat maps. Heat maps are the really the lifeblood of the Mitre Att\&ck framework. It documents the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for a specific software program, or for a specific threat group. If you are within your organization, if you see behavior, and you don't report it to the US cert  or other organizations, then you can use the heat maps to create it for your own internal purposes. Like your internal SOC, for example. So we'll take a look at that in the next video. In the next section, we'll look at the Att\&ck Navigator.
