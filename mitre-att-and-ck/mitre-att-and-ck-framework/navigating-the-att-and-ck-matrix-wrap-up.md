# Navigating the Att\&ck Matrix - Wrap-up

That covers the tactics that are used, and the goals of the threat actor activity. What are they trying to get? They may stop after they execute a command that searches a system for information. They zip it up, they exfiltrate it, and they're out of there. The malicious code may stay behind, or it may be set to automatically delete after reboot. The system they wanted, they were able to get it during their initial access, take the data and go.

TTP comes from - tactics, techniques and procedures. That's the Mitre Att\&ck framework. The way to look at this is to actually look at reports and start looking at the tactics associated with each one of them.

The Att\&ck Matrix is at attack.mitre.org. But I was showing you how you can use this completely offline for your own internal purposes, especially if the tech website is unavailable. You still have access to all this rich information.&#x20;

In the next section, we're going to use the Att\&ck navigator in order to start learning how to create heat maps. Heat maps are the really the lifeblood of the Mitre Att\&ck framework. It documents the TTPs for a specific software program, or for a specific threat group.
