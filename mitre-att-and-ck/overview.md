# Overview

This week is about the Mitre Att\&ck navigator and creating heatmaps. Please let me know if you have any questions. There is an assignment I want you to create a heatmap based on the capabilities of a software program and threat group. Please send me your heatmap and I'll provide some comments back on it and I'll send you my heatmap for comparison, as well.
